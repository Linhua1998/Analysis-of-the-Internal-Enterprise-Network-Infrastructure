# Analysis-of-the-Internal-Enterprise-Network-Infrastructure

Project description: Analysis of the Internal Enterprise Network Infrastructure

Short description: The project is a detailed analysis and optimization of the company's internal network infrastructure. The main focus is on improving the efficiency of NAT, improving routing and ensuring the security of network interaction. The project carried out an in-depth diagnosis of the current state of the network, identified possible bottlenecks and proposed solutions to eliminate them.

Project objectives:

âœ… Analysis of the existing network infrastructure of the enterprise and identification of problem areas.
âœ… Optimization of NAT (Network Address Translation) to improve network bandwidth.
 Develop a routing strategy based on OSPF and dynamic NAT.
 Implementation of network threat protection mechanisms (Firewall, IDS/IPS).
âœ… Improving network scalability for the future growth of the company.

The main stages of the project:

ðŸ”¹ Topological analysis:

Investigation of the existing network structure.
Identification of critical nodes and points of failure.
Load analysis on routers and switches.

NAT and routing configuration:

Implementation of Dynamic NAT to optimize the use of public IP addresses.
Using VRF Aware NAT to separate network segments.
Configure OSPF to balance traffic and increase fault tolerance.
Optimization of Port Address Translation (PAT) to reduce delays.

Network security:

Implementation of Firewall and IDS/IPS for monitoring and prevention of attacks.
Setting up a VPN and VLAN to isolate corporate data.
Using STUN/TURN servers to protect VoIP and video conferencing.

Technologies and tools used:

Equipment: Cisco routers and switches
Software: Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark
Protocols: NAT, OSPF, STUN/TURN, VPN, VRF
Security: IPsec, Firewall, IDS/IPS

Project results:

ðŸ”¹ Reduction of network delays by 25% due to NAT optimization and load balancing.
ðŸ”¹ Reducing the load on routers by 30% due to the introduction of dynamic NAT.
Improve network security, including protection against DDoS attacks and unauthorized access.
Development of a scalable architecture that allows easy integration of new offices and branches.

Conclusions and prospects:

The project has shown that proper configuration of NAT and routing can significantly improve the performance of the enterprise network. In the future, we can consider integrating SDN (Software-Defined Networking) for more flexible network management and process automation.
